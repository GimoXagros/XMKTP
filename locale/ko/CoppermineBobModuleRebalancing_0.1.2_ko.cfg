[mod-setting-description]
coppermine-bob-module-exponential-modules=Modules of each level now cost 2 modules of the previous level to craft (5 for God modules), making modules exponentially expensive in their level.  The intent is to encourage use of the lower level modules, which are otherwise rarely relevant.
coppermine-bob-module-nerfed-modules=The positive effects of the various modules are weakened, and their negative side-effects significantly increased.  In particular, speed (and raw speed) modules no longer make machines more efficient, and productivity (and raw productivity) modules come with severe energy and speed costs.  God modules (if enabled) become what raw productivity modules used to be.
coppermine-bob-module-expensive-module-combination=The combined-effect modules require different ingredients, including higher-tier plates.  If Bob's alien alloys are enabled, they will be required.  God modules (if enabled) are now crafted from other modules.
coppermine-bob-module-nerfed-beacons=Mk2 and mk3 beacons have reduced range and increaed energy cost and hold fewer modules.  They also now generate pollution.
coppermine-bob-module-expensive-beacons=Mk2 and mk3 beacons require pollution producing modules to craft.  With exponentially expensive modules enabled, this makes them very expensive, meaning that mk1 or mk2 beacons are a sensible choice in many situations.
coppermine-bob-module-modules-in-rocket=Use either raw speed module 8s (if enabled) or speed module 8s as an ingredient in rocket control units.  If exponential modules are enabled then one module suffices for 20 rocket control units, so that they are not too expensive.
coppermine-bob-module-space-packs-for-god-modules=Add space science packs as an ingredient for crafting god module 1.
coppermine-bob-module-god-module-research-multiplier=With the other changes god module research becomes cheaper than its prerequisites.  This multiplier (at the default value of 10) sets more reasonable research costs.
coppermine-bob-module-god-modules-in-space-ex=Those components which previously required all three module types now require god modules instead.  Has no effect if god modules are disabled.  If exponentially expensive modules are enabled then the number of god modules is scaled down to keep the requirements reasonable.
